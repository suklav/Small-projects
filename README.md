# Small-projects/Programs.
Topic: Small projects or programs built during leisure times.
It is the result of some sudden thoughts that came to my mind which I want to achieve using computer programs. 
I prefer writing programs mainly in Python, C++, C, Haskell, and Java.

Here is the list of programs available in this repository: 
1. [Email slicer using python ](Email-Slicer-using-python/)
2. [TIC-TAC-TOE](TIC-TAC-TOE)
3. [Cryptarithmatic Puzzle] (Cryptarithmatic-puzzle)
